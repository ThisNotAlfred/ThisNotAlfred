# Hi there, I'm Mohammad Ali Talebi 🦫

I do programming. I mean I do programming and tinkering. I like to tinker with stuff like linux and operating systems. 😃

I mostly program in Rust and C/C++. I used to program in Haskell too. I love compilers and operating systems. 

## Things I'm focused on at the moment:
- Linux 🐧
- Rust 🦀
- C/C++ 🖥️
- Operating Systems internals 💽

## Things I'm planning to learn: 
- Virtual Machines 💻
- Compilers (again) 🫠
